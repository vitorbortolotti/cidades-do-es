# \#DesafioCidadesDoES

This project is a simple game I created back in the day with a friend, using Angular.js (RIP), SVG maps, SCSS, and Firebase hosting.

The game consists basically in the player trying to remember/guess the name of all the cities in our home state, [Espirito Santo, Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esp%C3%ADrito_Santo). 
It's not a new idea whatsoever, but it was still fun to have a localized version to play with friends and family. 

### How to play

> Please do note that the game is only available in Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`). If you want to see how it works, 
follow the steps:

- Go to https://cidadesdo.es/
- Click the pink button "Iniciar"
- A text input will show up. Try typing "Serra", the city should light up in the map.

If you want to skip to the end and browse the interactive map, open the console and call `timeIsUp()`;
